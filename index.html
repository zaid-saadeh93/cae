         sport cars 
         The term sports car is usually applied to a two-seater vehicle designed for high-speed driving and maneuverability. Sports cars are divided between being simple and being luxurious, but in both categories, the most important thing is to achieve good control while driving and high performance, especially at high speeds.
        The origins of sports cars can be traced back to the first sports cars at the turn of the 20th century. These cars were used in the first rally races such as the Monte Carlo Rally.

         SLS 2020
         
        the SLS AMG's 6.2-Liter V8 engine could max it out at 563 hp (420 kW) and 479 lb-ft (650 Nm) torque. An even angrier version, albeit, electric (images above), could make up to 805 hp (600 kW).

        As mentioned, the Elmerhaus-tuned SLS AMG on the video is supercharged, enabling it to produce a whopping output of 1,025 hp. We're not entirely sure of the modifications done on the gullwing-doored coupe but we think the POV video is proof enough of its prowess.

          1969 Ford Mustang
            The first-generation Ford Mustang was manufactured by Ford from March 1964 until 1973. The introduction of the Mustang created a new class of automobile known as the pony car. The Mustang’s styling, with its long hood and short deck, proved wildly popular and inspired a host of competition.

            The car is powered by a massive a 5.0-liter Ford Coyote V-8 mated to a six-speed Tremec manual gear box that’s capable of churning out 345 horses. If that’s not enough for you, a twin turbocharged engine with a staggering 1000 horsepower is also available as an option.

         BMW M5 
         The BMW M TwinPower Turbo 8-cylinder petrol engine from the BMW M5 Competition is the most powerful engine developed by BMW M GmbH for its production series. The 460 kW (625 hp) 4.4-liter power unit is distinguished by its direct and quick response, linear performance characteristics and consistently high torque even at low revs. Equipped with high-pressure direct injection, two ultra-dynamic TwinScroll turbochargers and a cross-exhaust manifold, the weight-optimized high-performance power unit sets clear signs on the road and on the racetrack: 750 Nm of torque, acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h in 3.3 seconds and from 0 to 200 km/h in 10.8 seconds.
